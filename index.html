    <h1>Morph to CATS¹ (from tab-separated data)</h1>
    <p>Copy data from Excel pivot table and paste into the raw input field.
      First row must contain dates (integers) and may have missing days for holidays and weekends.
      First column must have account numbers.
      The table data must be the effort for one account on a specific day (floating point number, using the German format).
      Efforts will be rounded to 2 digits.</p>

    <p>Check your input, then morph to right-most view (in-between views are for interest only).  Align the calendar by
      setting first of month to the correct day of the week (useful for views showing weeks).
    </p>

    <p>In all but the first view, rows for accounts with a total of zero efforts in that week will not be shown.  In
      final view, lines in one week are grouped in blocks of six lines (because CATS will let you add at most six lines
      at once — possibly this is configurable).
    </p>
    <p>¹Name is of course an hommage to “Morph the Cat” by Donald Fagen</p>
