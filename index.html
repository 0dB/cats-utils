    <h1>Morph to CATS¹ (from tab-separated data)</h1>
    <p>Copy data from Excel pivot table and paste into the raw input field.
      First row must contain dates (integers) and may have missing days for holidays and weekends.
      First column must have account numbers.
      The table data must be the effort for one account on a specific day (floating point number, using the German format).
      Efforts will be rounded to 2 digits.</p>

    <p>Check your input first using "Raw" view, then morph to right-most view (in-between views are for interest only).
      In the views showing weeks, align the calendar by setting first of month to the right day of the week.
    </p>

    <p>In the final output (for copy and paste to CATS), for each week, accounts with a total of zero efforts in that
      week will not be shown.  Lines in one week are grouped in blocks of six lines (because CATS will let you add at
      most six lines at once).
    </p>
    <p>¹Name is of course an hommage to “Morph the Cat” by Donald Fagen</p>
