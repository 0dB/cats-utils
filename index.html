    <h1>CATS Utilities</h1>
    <p>Copy data from Excel pivot table and paste into the raw input field.
      First row must contain dates (integers) and may have missing days for holidays and weekends.
      First column must have account numbers.
      The table data must be the effort for one account on a specific day (floating point number, using the German format).
      Efforts will be rounded to 2 digits.</p>

    <p>Check your input first using "Raw" view, then switch to "Weeks" view ("Normalize" and "Month" are for interest only).</p>
      
    <p>In "Weeks" view, align the calendar by setting first of month to the right day of the week.
      In the output, for each week, accounts with a total of zero efforts in that week will not be shown.
      Lines in one week are grouped in blocks of six lines each to help organize the copy and paste (CATS will let you add at most six lines at once).
